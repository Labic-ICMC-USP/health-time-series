# PPG Guilin

PPG Guilin [1] is a dataset created to help develop methods to detect cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in a non-invasive way. It can be used for studies that propose new time series methods or algorithms that use photoplethysmograph signals (PPG) to detect patterns or ways to diagnose CVD and evaluate the most important signal features to the diagnoses.

## Data Description

In development.
