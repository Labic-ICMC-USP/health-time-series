# Labic Health Time Series Repository

This repository is built on top of [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and [MkDocs Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/), aiming to facilitate the development and creation of pages while maintaining the project's simplicity since it is just a guide page for the original Zenodo repository.

## About the Project

This repository aims to facilitate the development and study of algorithms involving time series in the health area, establishing patterns of splits, transformations, and tasks in the data available in the literature and some data sets collected by the project. The idea is to gather the sets in a single repository, facilitating the comparison between algorithms and methods. All references to the sets taken from the literature are included in their respective pages.

## Contributing

To contribute to the repository with page modifications, simply create a fork of the repository in your account, make the modifications, and submit a Pull Request. **Remember**: to keep everyone aware of what you are doing, also create an issue informing what you are working on (this way, we avoid having two or more people contributing to the same thing).

## Setup the dev environment

Once you have created the fork of the repository, simply clone it and run the following command in the root folder to view the site locally:

```shell
mkdocs serve
```
